    "Data with error bars can be combined with a physical model to infer physical information from the data. $\\chi^2$ fitting is a statistical method of \"inference\" that can both determine model parameters as well as error bars. The crux of the method is as follows:  when creating a best-fit curve, data points with small error bars are well known, so the best-fit curve should be closest to those, and data points with larger error bars are less-well-known, so the best-fit curve can be further away from these.\n",

    "**First,** let's load some data and make a graph.  Download ``Lab3Data.csv``, then use ``np.loadtxt(...)`` to create three arrays, ``independent_variables``, ``data``, and ``uncertainties`` which correspond to the 0, 1, and 2 columns of the file.\n",
