    "Data with error bars can be combined with a physical model to infer physical information from the data. $\\chi^2$ fitting is a statistical method of \"inference\" that can both determine model parameters as well as error bars. The crux of the method is as follows:  when creating a best-fit curve, data points with small error bars are well known, so the best-fit curve should be closest to those, and data points with larger error bars are less-well-known, so the best-fit curve can be further away from these.\n",
